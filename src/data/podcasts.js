        title: 'Unlocking Productivity from the Hard Hat Movement with Will Woodhead',

        description: 'In this weekâ€™s pod, we welcomed Will Woodhead to discuss unlocking productivity from the hardhat movement. Will is an engineer by trade who has spent nearly his entire career to date working overseas. At age 21 he was sent to Dalian in northern China for a year by his employer to work on a floating production platform. We Will then move to a further 7 different countries in Asia and West Africa working on the design, construction and offshore installation of oil & gas facilities. During this time Will went back to University in Shanghai, and learnt to speak, read and write Mandarin. Nearly 20 years later he started Mafic, a construction tech company that has created an alternative payment mechanism that allows tradespeople to get paid a bonus if they graft.It works by recognising the activity someone is doing from the movement of their head alone. The system can detect very subtle changes in productivity and schedule and hence in aggregation can be used to understand exactly how a construction site is performing and where the biggest opportunities in productivity and health and safety lie. The main topics we discussed on the podcast were as follows: Productivity is simply the cost per unit of work done. This allows companies to look at the bottom line and allows meaningful comparisons between methods of working. Efficiency doesnâ€™t focus on individual outputs but is more linked to wastage. Effectiveness is based on the objective you are trying to achieve e.g. profit or net zero targets. Productivity means looking at problems with fresh eyes and trying a different approach. There are many ways in which projects should look to define success outside of the traditional iron triangle (time, cost, quality). This could be in the form of environmental benefits, upskilling local economies, social responsibility. There is a huge value in having a diversity of thought and experience in project teams to drive productivity. The data from the Mafic hardhat technology shows workers are primarily motivated by money. If you measure the productivity of a team of workers, there will always be a hierarchy of performance. Getting rid of the lowest performer(s) doesnâ€™t correlate to greater efficiency whereas motivational techniques will have a direct influence. Companies should not seek to offer overtime during the week as a productivity initiative as the productivity level will be around 60%, companies should aim for weekends.',

        title: 'Why building cycling cities are so important with Chris Bruntlett',
        file_name: 'c4e965995dee7d0b31d1e0fe4a3291f9.m4a',
        description: 'In this episode Val and special co-host Joseph Ballouz talk about connecting and shaping cities with bike and placemaking enthusiast Chris Bruntlett. Chris Bruntlett is Marketing and Communication Manager at the Dutch Cycling Embassy, a public-private partnership that represents the best knowledge, experience, and experts from the Netherlands. As a long-time campaigner in Vancouver, he fell in love with Dutch bike culture in 2016, inspiring him to co-author the book, â€œBuilding the Cycling City: The Dutch Blueprint for Urban Vitalityâ€. Chris uses his knowledge and passion to share practical lessons for global cities wishing to follow their footsteps, and become better places to live, work, andâ€”of courseâ€”cycle. His latest book is â€œCurbing Traffic: The Human Case for Fewer Cars in our Livesâ€.',

        title: 'AI in Infrastructure and how it is going to change our cities with Rita Arrigo',
        file_name: 'bc1d7709aff58acdb6e4472f74f5a750.m4a',
        description: 'In this weekâ€™s pod, we welcomed Rita Arrigo to discuss AI in Infrastructure and how it is going to change our cities. As a natural storyteller excited by the opportunities the tech world brings, Rita can translate complex technical ideas across the â€˜IT divideâ€™ to those less tech-minded, an enthusiastic advocate and sought-after speaker for many years on all thingâ€™s innovation and digital. The main topics we discussed on the podcast were as follows: AI, Machine Learning and Spatial Computing are moving at a fast pace. Most construction projects are using paper based documents on site despite the prevalence of digital technology. There is not enough diversity in engineering which has led to a lack of challenging the status quo which is stifling disruption. Digital Twin seeks to connect the past and predict the future. AI can be used by governments to help them monitor and achieve COP 26/27 commitments. Maturing of toolsets will give us higher capability and reduce the workload. CEOâ€™s now need to understand the digital technology their company provides rather than simply relying on the technical experts. AI will never replace human interactions. Blockchain help accelerate investment cycles for companies. People always need visualizations â€“ AI will support and enable this. Technology will change the way we collect and store information on projects which will make the traditional â€œfilingâ€ system redundant. We donâ€™t perceive the world, we only see what we perceive.',
